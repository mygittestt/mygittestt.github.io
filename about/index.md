Hi All

I’m working as Tech Lead in an IT company. I am a Citrix, RHCE and MCP Certified Admin.

Certifications I've completed so far:  

**Citrix Certified Administrator (XenApp 6.5)** \
**Citrix Certified Administrator (XenDesktop 5)** \
**Citrix Certified Administrator (XenServer 6)** \
**Citrix Certified Associate (XenDesktop 7)** \
**Vmware Certified(VCA-DCV)** \
**AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**  

After working for 2 years in infrastructure support team, I have moved into VMware and Citrix application support platform. While I was in  IT team, I have seen lot of technical issues related to Operating Systems, servers etc.. I have great passion for creating website and sharing it because IT is not just learning but sharing too.

Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.

Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.

Thanks for stopping by!
