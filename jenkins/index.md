What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java programming language that allows continuous integration.

Jenkins builds and tests our software projects which continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.

It also allows us to continuously deliver our software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.

Jenkins offers a straightforward way to set up a continuous integration or continuous delivery environment for almost any combination of languages and source code repositories using pipelines, as well as automating other routine development tasks.

With the help of Jenkins, organizations can speed up the software development process through automation. Jenkins adds development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy static analysis and much more.

Jenkins achieves CI (Continuous Integration) with the help of plugins. Plugins is used to allow the integration of various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you have to install the plugins for that tool. For example: Maven 2 Project, Git, HTML Publisher, Amazon EC2, etc.

For example: If any organization is developing a project, then Jenkins will continuously test your project builds and show you the errors in early stages of your development.

Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:

Perform a software build using a build system like Gradle or Maven Apache
  Execute a shell script
  Archive a build result
  Running software tests
